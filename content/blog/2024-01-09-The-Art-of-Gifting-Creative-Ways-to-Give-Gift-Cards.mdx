## Introduction

Gift cards are a convenient and versatile gift option, but they can sometimes feel impersonal. With a little creativity, however, you can turn a simple gift card into a thoughtful and memorable present. Here are a few innovative and fun ways to give gift cards that will make your loved ones smile:

## 1. Personalize the Gift Card

- **Customize the Gift Card Holder:** Instead of using a plain gift card holder, create one that is unique and personal to the recipient. You can use cardstock, scrapbook paper, or a photo frame to create a holder that reflects their personality or interests.

- **Add a Personal Touch:** Write a handwritten note or message on the gift card holder, or add a small gift tag with a special message. You can also attach a photo of you and the recipient to make the gift even more meaningful.

## 2. Create a Themed Gift Card Basket
