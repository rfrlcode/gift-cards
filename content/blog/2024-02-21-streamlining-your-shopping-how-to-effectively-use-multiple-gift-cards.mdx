Organize your gift cards by creating a spreadsheet or using a note-taking app. Include information like the card number, balance, expiration date, and store where it can be redeemed. This will help you quickly find the right card when you need it and avoid missing out on unused balances or expired cards.


## Prioritizing Which Gift Cards to Use

When you have multiple gift cards, decide which ones to use first. Start with cards that have lower balances or are approaching their expiration dates. This ensures that you maximize the value of your cards before they become unusable.


## Combining Gift Cards When Possible

If possible, combine multiple gift cards into a single card. This simplifies your wallet and makes it easier to keep track of your balance. Some stores allow you to merge gift cards online or in-store. Check with the store's customer service for details.

Take advantage of gift cards for online purchases. Many stores now accept gift cards as a payment option online. This allows you to use your gift cards even when you don't have them with you. Be sure to check the store's website or contact customer service to confirm if they accept gift cards for online use.


## Checking Balances Regularly
